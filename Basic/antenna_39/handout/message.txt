I'm so excited to visit Japan to see Miku in Magical Mirai 2024 event!
As I arrive at the airport, I did the usual stuff and my plane is boarding at --GATE 39--
'How Lovely, This year's theme song also has 39 in its name,' I thought. 
Then I remembered something: I forgot to create a challenge for Cyberus' Intern event. 
And here we are! I hope you can do something with these numbers, I'm heading out now. Bye!
