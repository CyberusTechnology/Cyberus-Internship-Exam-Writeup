Observing the source code, we can see that the JavaScript functions have been obfuscated, which makes it hard to understand. If we assume the flag is hidden within the JavaScript code, we can use the browser’s debug tool to track down the variable that holds the flag. However, the problem is that   we don’t know where the flag is, so we should find the line of code that deals with the input and start debugging from there.
