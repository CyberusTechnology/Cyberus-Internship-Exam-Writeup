After reading the message you should be able to tell that there is something with 
the number `39` since it is mentioned 3 times, and there is also a big hint like 
-- GATE 39 --, this should indicate that you have to do some gate operation with 
`39` and something and there is those numbers that is given at the bottom of the 
`message.txt`. With this knowledge you can either use cyberchef or a python script 
to solve this challenge.

```python
enc = [0x41, 0x4b, 0x46, 0x40, 0x5c, 0x4a, 0x5e, 0x78, 0x48, 0x45, 0x54, 0x54, 0x42, 0x54, 0x4e, 0x48, 0x49, 0x78, 0x50, 0x4e, 0x53, 0x4f, 0x78, 0x51, 0x48, 0x44, 0x46, 0x4b, 0x48, 0x4e, 0x43, 0x78, 0x4e, 0x54, 0x78, 0x40, 0x42, 0x53, 0x53, 0x4e, 0x49, 0x40, 0x78, 0x48, 0x52, 0x53, 0x78, 0x48, 0x41, 0x78, 0x4f, 0x46, 0x49, 0x43, 0x5a]
flag = "".join(chr(i ^ 39) for i in enc)
print(flag)
```
